# Prime Menu – Deterministic Prime Number Engine

This repository contains a powerful and fast deterministic engine to explore, analyze, and predict prime numbers without using probabilistic methods or primality tests like `isprime()`.

The system is based on a set of original mathematical formulas that allow the generation and analysis of prime numbers through purely logical and constructive rules.

## 🔍 Features

- 🔢 Generate prime numbers using a deterministic gap function: `dₙ = 1 + C(pₙ)`
- ⚡ Predict the next prime without trial division
- 🧮 Prime factorization module (optional menu 8)
- 🌀 Prime spiral visualizations (2D/3D optional)
- 🔁 Advanced filtering using modular residue and primorial masks
- 📊 Graphs: `pₙ vs n`, prime gaps, and structural patterns
- 🧠 Bit-based logic to analyze prime behavior
